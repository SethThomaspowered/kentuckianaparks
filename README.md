# kentuckianaparks
This project is designed to give users an easy way to find parks in Louisville, Kentucky and the surrounding counties.

CSS: I used the nthchild to shade the rows of the tables different colors. 
I used flexbox to format my tables.

Javascript:
Created an array of park addresses and an array of park features.
I wrote code to allow users to search for parks and features.
Used Local Storage to allow users to save their favorite parks or parks they would like to visit.
